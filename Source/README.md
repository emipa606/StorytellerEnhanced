# Storyteller Enhanced
Rimworld mod that adds more storytellers and difficulty options to create new challenges

This mod adds four new storytellers to the game to extend the vanilla storytellers. It also adds extra difficulties above just increasing raid-size with the goal to create new challenges and gameplay experience.

These storytellers are meant to enhance your Rimworld experience, in general by improving the threat cycles and story event triggers. You will get more events compared to the equivalent vanilla storyteller, but no meme-guy trowing something like 10 events a day at you. Choose between Calista Complex, Raya Relaxed, Matt Moody or Nora Nothing, depending on whether you like to chill or suffer. Compared to vanilla, these storytellers have a way more complex threat cycle, which add a greater variety of stuff that can happen and makes them sometimes less predictable. Each of them has his/her own style which you can see in the name and description.

## New storyteller

#### Calista Complex
Calista creates story events on a more complex schedule. She likes to see how you can handle different situations. Expect the unexpected.

#### Raya Relaxed
Raya creates a relaxing story for you. Sometimes she adds an extra event to give you a little surprise, but thats more often a nice gift or to spice up your day than a threat.

#### Matt Moody
Matt is famous for his mood swings. You will have a good time with balanced events, but occasionally when he gets in the mood, he makes your life a living hell.

#### Nora Nothing
Nora doesn't give much about telling a story, she won't make any incidents and just watches you playing. Use her if you want to write your own story or for a slightly different challenge in remote regions.

## New difficulties

#### Murderous
Murderous as the name says it all. Enemies are plentiful, colonists are angry, prices are worse and of cause everything bad that 'Extreme' can offer. For those who love the unwinnable fight against hordes of bloodthirsty monsters.

#### Post-Apocalyptic
The main challenge comes from very few resources combined with a large number of enemies who try to steal the last bit of food you could harvest from this destroyed and polluted world. For those who want an alternative challenge to just raid size. This is a true challenge of you vs the world.

#### Spoiled Life
Pawns are spoiled from glitterworld life. They have less motivation to work, need more recreation time and are harder to keep happy. For those who want an alternative challenge to just raid size. This is a true challenge of you vs your colonists.
